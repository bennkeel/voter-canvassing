## Collaboration 
We collaborated mostly within this document:

In order to establish a user experience that would work well with Mjumbe's example, Ben outlined a user journey, the user flow, and some basic wireframes. We all then met on the design of the wireframes, and reviewed what would deliver the base requirements with good usability for the intended audience. This required some adjustments from the base idea (seen in the skipped slides at the bottom of the presentation).

At the end of this collaborative meeting, we outlined the functions associated with each wireframe and element.

Eric offered to create the first map and list loading functions, and Min followed up with populating the address list from the selected voter 00list. Ben restructured the address list function to load addresses instead of individuals, then made a click function to show address details at each location. 

Currently we're working through showing the questions for each voter, saving those notes, then loading them each time details are expanded.
